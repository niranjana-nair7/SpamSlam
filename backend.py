- "confidence": float (0.0 to 1.0)
- "key_indicators": list of strings explaining why this is spam

Examples of spam types:

# Sarcastic response generation prompt

Generate a witty, sarcastic response to this spam call. The response should be:
- Funny and clever
- Obviously sarcastic
- Safe for work
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Exposes the absurdity of the scam

Spam type: {spam_type}
Original transcript: "{transcript}"

Make it specific to the type of scam. Examples:

- For tech support: Play dumb about technology
- For warranty scams: Reference absurd vehicles

Just return the sarcastic response, nothing else.
